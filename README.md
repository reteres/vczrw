The boss store was very funny, in the direction of the street wall mount a big glass window, to put a 5 layer of shelf, shelf on the markings of the beautiful and colorful little hat.
Someone passing only the street, you can see the bright hat, and on the outbreak of this shop boss hobby.
/ > hometown in southern hunan, extension of nanling flows is full of hills, forests and paddy fields is the tone in my youth, and the spring up of pre-pubescent naturally became the voice of my childhood accompaniment, a series of frogs be compounding my memory.
The frog is beneficial insects is not my first impression of the frog, it was off to school in the school next door when my teacher teach my aunt, and this proposition in now seems to be accepted by the public in the youth does not cause my attention, even said that I have no don't care about the frog is beneficial insects.
Many from rural children will like me mentioned the frog on the memory of childhood, they will naturally said the frog to hear pre-pubescent that oneself like, will give the frogs in the childhood memories of many good vision, partners or the fairy tales about his frog prince.
However, I am not so, I on the function of the frog in the childhood is really on the surface it can be sold now, I know in the fair in the town people's congress spend collecting frogs, then walking off to the city, it is said that the table has a "frog", is on "class".
So there will be a frog, can catch a few jins, also can switch back to a number of yuan currency.
In real life, as long as it can be sold, someone will always do it.
Childhood, a frog in my eyes is money.
Yes, not everyone has childhood fairy tales, I like the frog, and the mother with sell hair into the sorghum broom to pad my school first tuition and other expenses are often earned I catch fish catch frogs.
Catch frogs is the thinnest in this outfit, literally in the back of the house of cut down a slender bamboo in the bamboo forest, and you get a long term in order to find the rods, and the bag is the father of frog used fiber bag, in order to meet the hooks frog we often put the fiber bag flowing through to become a round, make the whole fiber bag a open bag, then we have no spare wire, southern hunan hills have plenty of YouChaShu and bamboo, and their branches were particularly resilient elastic, let's get a cutting them into a circle and then into fiber bag is ok, as far as the bait, it is more interesting, tanabe casually crushed to death a little thumb size is little frog plug it online, and it is the head of the childhood I always do not ask why want to use the little green frog big frog such problem, I and my partners along the way before repeatedly with the same bait, we want the result is we can only catch more to the frog.
Everything ready to tools that nature is all the beginning, we often choose the sun just as according to choose to travel at about 11, we each thought that the frog is I the rest of us at about twelve o 'clock for lunch, at noon and we feel hungry they will desperately looking for food.
Till now I did not ask why frogs around noon is feeding period, but in fact we were often get not bad harvest at noon.
We are often in tissue embroidered jacket to go out, the midday sun care we are often the result of our tan shoulders leave traces of his red peeling, revealing the skin black, and has a few white jacket to cover the place.
Like all investments have risk, so also catch frogs, childhood we fear most is to catch a snake, we work all day catch frogs will have to pour out because of the snake, because the old man said, the most poisonous snake bitten by a snake, frog, bitten by such a frog or eating frogs will die like this.
Have been clever to think anyway, is sold to the city, we don't say don't know their nature, old lifetime will tell, we are going to have a conscience, don't do it for money black conscience, at this point, all people remember live frogs of the snakes don't sell the old adage.
Now, to remember those things, I often touched by that a simple, no one witness bitten by a snake, frog, just because of worry, which our forefathers we honest folks have been careful to carry out the old adage, maintained the conscience of that kind of bright red color.
Home has no catch frogs, like the one I like children, at least they have become money than I usually see a frog.
Those a few still through fishing by the rice frog, but in order to find a belong to the taste of childhood, and for the function of the frog fishing was and as the years went by and already quietly but go to, including my lost childhood.
